# Creative Portion!
- Sorting Algorithm!
  > Users can view the stories sorted by date or popularity! A story in which many people "Like" could be displayed in the front, or the other case a story in which many people dislike can be displayed as Controversial. Many options are provided through different Queries in the Database.
- Appealing Seperated Story Page!
  > Piles of Files provides an appealing seperated story page! When you click on the title of each story on the main page, an appealing seperated page will be displayed, containing the contents and comments related to this story! You could also add your own comment here after you log in.
- "Like" or "Dislike" a story!
  > Piles of Files provides you an opportunity to "Like" or "Dislike" a story! You could click on "Like" at the end of every story if you are attracted by this topic, and if you are disgusted by the content, you can 'dislike' a story, as well. The homepage would provide a function to sort the stories according to their popularity!
- Searching Features!
  > We implemented a search feature! Scrolling through file name after file name can be tedious. Thus, we implemented a feature where you can type a string of text in the search bar and hit the 'search' button thus displaying the title of stories that matches or contains what was searched!
