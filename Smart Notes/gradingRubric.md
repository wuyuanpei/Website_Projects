- Welcome to SmartNotes!
 > This is a note-taking website on which college students can write, edit, and organize notes.
 SmartNotes allows you to write notes through different modules: definitions, theorems, example problems, etc.
 The only thing you need to do is to drag different modules into your notes and fill the blanks.
 Then SmartNotes can help you organize and view notes in different ways conveniently (through the order of date, different courses and tags, etc).
 Most importantly, SmartNotes can quickly generate reviewing materials, practice tests, or cheat sheets for you to download and prepare for exams!
 SmartNotes also supports sharing notes with other students, and professors distributing notes to students.
