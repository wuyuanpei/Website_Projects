# Creative Portion!
- Tag!
  > Users could set a specific tag to each event associated with the title and the time. When a date on the calendar is clicked, you will see all events on that day with tag in bold.
- Show Events with a specific Tag!
  > Our calendar provides a selection menu for you to display events with a specific tag. The selection menu will stay in the state "show all" by default. However, the options in the selection menu will display all possible tags of your events. When you click on one of them, our calendar will only display the events with this tag.
- Share an Event to your friend!
  > Our calendar provides you an opportunity to share an event with your friend! You could click on a date in the calendar and click the "share" button after an event. As long as you type a correct username, this event could be shared to this user!
- Quick Move to any year and any month!
  > In our calendar, you no longer need to press "Next Month" or "Previous Month" for multiple times. We provide a textfield which will help you move to a specific month and year. Just type in the textfield with the format mm/yyyy! For example, 04/2201 will let you move to April 2201. We use regular expression to detect whether the input is legal or not. As long as it is in mm/yyyy, the program will direct you to there automatically. Our detection is robost and perfect. The input range is from 01/1500 to 12/2500
- Today!
  > Our calendar will automatically detect the date returned by your brower, and will display the page with today's month and put a different color on the grid of today's date.
- Refresh and Reconnect!
  > Our calendar page will never be refreshed for any operation on it. However, if a user intentionally refreshes the page, our calendar will automatically reconnect to the server if the user has logged in before.

# Login Details! Welcome to our Calendar!

  >After you log in, click on a specifc date, you will see all the events on that day. At the bottom, you can "Post an Event" and each event provides the options of "delete","edit", and "share".
- Attention!!!
  >When adding or editing an event, the input time should be in the format of "HH:mm". For example, "17:30" means 5:30 p.m. Again, we use regular expression to detect every input, any illegal input will be prevent from being inserted to database.
- Attention!!!
  >After you click on a specific date, if the dialog window shows nothing, resize it a little bit. You will be fine if your zoom is 100% and you are in Google Chrome.
